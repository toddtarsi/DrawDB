# DrawDB
I'm learning about React by making a drawing tool.

In the process, I'm playing with isomorphism, d3, redux, and react. This is still completely nonfunctional, and there are lots of things left to do to make it work.

Things left to do:

 * SVG particle representations for schema, field, and relation (probably more particle data needed as well)
 * Event binding & structure representations
 * Server data binding and data persistence

Feel free to look around regardless, PR's always appreciated.
