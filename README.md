# DrawDB
Learning about React by making a drawing tool.
Playing with isomorphism, d3, redux, and react. Still completely nonfunctional, lots of things left to do to make it work.

Things left to do:
SVG particle representations
Event binding & Structure representations
Server data binding and persistence

Feel free to look around regardless, PR's always appreciated.
